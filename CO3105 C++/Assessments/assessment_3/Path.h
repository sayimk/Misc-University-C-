/*
 * This assignment practices the usage of STL.
 * The class is a data structure that contains the points of a path
 * in 2D space.
 * The path always starts at the initial point (0,0) and then
 * can be extended by moving in one of 8 directions (see enum
 * Direction).
 *
 * There are various other options to do with the path the most
 * complicated of which is redirecting it to a stream.
 *
 * Comments near the different functions give further details about
 * the different members.

  // Extend the first path by the second path.
  // So the (0,0) point of the second path is
  // put on the end point of the first path
  // and the same steps as in the second are retraced.
  //
  // For example, if the path through which this is called is:
  // (0,0), (0,1)
  // and the other path is:
  // (0,0), (1,1)
  // Then their sum should be:

  // The - operation basically walks the other path
  // backwards along the original path.
  // So if the end of the first path does not end in
  // a matching way the operation should fail and send
  // std::exception.
  // Otherwise, walk back the other path from the end of
  // the first path.
  // If the first path gets empty (goes back to the origin)
  // then continue going backward.
  //
  // For example:
  // c=a+a  - + always works
  // d=c-a  - now c ends in the same directions as a
  // e=d-c  - now the suffix of c matches that of d and can
  //          be reduce. IT consists of the walking the reverse of
  //          a from the origin
  // f=0-a  - f should be equivalent to e
  //
  // Or starting from:
  // (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,2),(1,1),(0,1)  - N,N,E,S,W
  // and subtracting:
  // (0,0),(1,0),(1,-1),(0,-1) - E,S,W
  // should get:
  // (0,0),(0,1),(0,2)
  // Now substracting:
  // (0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2) - E,N,N
  // should get:
  // (0,0),(-1,0)
  // Which is equivalent to just going west on a fresh path

  // This is different from length because if a path visits
  // the same point multiple times in terms of space all the
  // visits are counted as 1.
  int space() const;
  
  // Output the path as follows.
  // Each point in the path is represented by a 3x3 textual area
  // where the point itself is in the center.
  // The path should be printed as we are used to seeing
  // the grid: 0,0 is below 0,1
  //           0,0 is to the left of 1,0
  //           -1,0 is to the left of 0,0
  //           0,-1 is below 0,0
  // and so on.
  //
  // The first point in the path should be marked by the letter s
  // The last point in the path should be marked by the letter e
  // every other point in the path should be marked by the letter o
  //
  // The path itself is marked by using the space around the point
  // by marking how the path went from point to point.
  // So for example a section where the path went E should
  // be represented by (where * marks the limit of the area that
  // I'm talking about (but should not be printed)

  // information about the parts before/after this E):
